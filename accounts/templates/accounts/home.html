        <h2>The Primal Prowess Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="philosophy">I consider myself to be an "outside of the box" practitioner. I'm a divergent thinker and
            believe that one cannot
            design the superior athlete without being unconventional, or otherwise unorthodox, in the training methods
            implemented. I'm classically educated like most of society. Although I see the relevance in this, I also
            strongly feel that self-education through experience is just as necessary; this is what truly separates me
            from
            others. I believe that these unique, personal experiences have allowed me to extrapolate my own
            epistemological
            protocols. One tends to be regarded as "taboo" or “going against the grain” when implementing avant garde
            methods of performance conditoning. However, xenogamy of principles is pertinent to diversity and innovation
            within training methodology.</p>
        <p class="philosophy">If one desires to achieve a level of athleticism unlike anyone has ever seen, then one
            must
            also strive to train like no one else. What will put you at an advantage over the hungry, vicious
            competition?
            Your arsenal of athletic abilities must be developmentally sound and devastating to the opposition. Upon
            subscribing to this site, you will have the resources required to pull back on the throttle of your primal,
            infinite potential.</p>
